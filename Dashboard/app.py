                            ## Key Takeaways
                            -  Based on the data regarding the number of trips made and the distance covered per asset make, it can be observed that smaller vehicles tend to have a higher number of trips made compared to larger vehicles.
                            ## Recommendations
                            -  To improve their operations, Yatsa should consider placing greater emphasis on Public Service Vehicles. Our assumption is that smaller vehicles such as tuk-tuks and Piaggios are classified as PSVs therefore it may be beneficial for Yatsa to concentrate their efforts on this caetegory of vehicles as they are covering much distance.
                            -  Yatsa may consider expanding its market to different regions in the country. By exploiting new geographic areas, you can tap into new customer bases and potentially increase your revenue.
                            ## Suggestions
                            -  It may be worth considering providing us with fuel consumption data in the future, as this would allow for more comprehensive insights to be drawn from the data collected from your fleet of vehicles.
